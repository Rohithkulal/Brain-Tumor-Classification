# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This repository consists the project code of the brain tumor classification. The classification are done by using the CNN method. The brain tumor image dataset is collected from the kaggle. The images are preprocessed and then trained using CNN and we got the 94% of the training accuracy for the 20 epochs. For this project further improvements can be done.
